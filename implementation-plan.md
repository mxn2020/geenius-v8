# Geenius Prototype - Admin AI Management System

## Project Overview

Geenius is an admin interface for creating and managing agentic AI systems that process workflows within projects. The system allows you to build AI agent hierarchies, assign them to workflows, and execute coordinated tasks with full lifecycle tracking and monitoring.

## Core Architecture

### Foundation Types
- `Project` - Contains workflows, AI structures, and execution history
- `Agent` - AI entity with role, protocol, workflow pattern, memory, and configuration
- `AgentStructure` - Hierarchical organization of agents with relationships and coordination rules
- `Workflow` - Sequence of tasks with dependencies and execution parameters
- `Task` - Individual work unit with inputs, outputs, and agent assignments
- `Execution` - Runtime instance of workflow processing with full lifecycle tracking

### Agent Role Hierarchy
- **Planners** - Design agentic AI structures, create hierarchies, reshape team organization
- **Directors** - Strategic decisions, project oversight, resource authorization, final approvals
- **Coordinators** - Team management, timeline handling, quality standards, expert allocation
- **Experts** - Domain leadership, task distribution, progress tracking, integration management  
- **Builders** - Implementation execution, problem solving, system integration
